  - changes the start up display of the main helm screens
    - Centre Screen now defaults to display ocean current and sets zoom level to match the left screen to give a better overview of the map
    - Right Screen now defaults to display ocean depth and sets zoom level to match the left screen to give a better overview of the map

  - adds ID number of detected aircraft and ships (green)
  - adds direction heading (white line) to aircarft and ships (white)
